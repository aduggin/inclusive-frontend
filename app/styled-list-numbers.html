    <h1>Styled list numbers</h1>

    <h2>Demo</h2>

    <ol class="styled-list-numbers">
        <li>Check the value of your pension pot</li>
        <li>What you can do with your pension pot</li>
        <li>Plan how long your money needs to last</li>
        <li>Work out how much money you'll have in retirement</li>
        <li>Tax you pay on your pension</li>
        <li>How to shop around for the best deal</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Challenge</h2>

    <p>To use css to style the numbers rather than using images as this will be more performant (fewer http requests)
        and
        more scalable (easy to change the colors, not dependent on having the image for a specific number)</p>

    <p>To make sure that browser that do not support the css still present the content as a number list</p>

    <h2>Acceptance criteria</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Modern browsers display styled numbers</li>
        <li>Browser that do not support border radius and ::before render a normal ordered list</li>
        <li>Screen reader read out the list like a normal ordered list - with no duplication of numbers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Normal ordered list for test purposes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Check the value of your pension pot</li>
        <li>What you can do with your pension pot</li>
        <li>Plan how long your money needs to last</li>
        <li>Work out how much money you'll have in retirement</li>
        <li>Tax you pay on your pension</li>
        <li>How to shop around for the best deal</li>
    </ol>
